Meetup Map is an application that displays information about upcoming meetups in a certain city. This information is conveyed graphically using Google Maps which shows the location of the meetups with markers which can be clicked to display additional details. Information about the same meetups can be accessed in a more efficient and convenient way through a box containing that information in a list format with a search function. The application is responsive in the sense that once the viewport is below a certain size, the aforementioned box becomes horizontally aligned with the search function removed, but still allowing the user to quickly scroll through information about meetups. In whatever case, clicking on the list items causes the corresponding markers to display their info windows. A bar to the top displays the name of the city in question and the user can type in a new city to see the meetups happening there.
